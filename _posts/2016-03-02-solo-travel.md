So you've got your annual leave sorted but no one to go away with...well no worries\! I've been in this predicament many times and they have turned into some of the most amazing trips I've ever had\!

First thing I do is decide where I want to go and then start looking at small group touring options, this is a great way to travel solo but have the guarantee you'll meet some great like minded travellers along the way and a lot of people go on these trips solo so don't be worried about being the odd woman out\!&nbsp;

Another reason I love to travel this way is a lot of these companies include local experiences that you might otherwise miss (like a homestay on a farm in a small village in Costa Rica, which helps create income from tourism to the local community).&nbsp;

It also really takes the hassle out of all the planning for you, all your transport, accommodation and some meals are included but you still get time to yourself in each place so you can go off and do your own thing (so if you're a bit of an introvert like myself you can still have some time to yourself).
