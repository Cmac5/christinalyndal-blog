Not sure where to even start with planning your next adventure….

If can be overwhelming with so many options and so much information out there so here are a few tips to help get you started.&nbsp;

First ask yourself these questions…

1. Summer or Winter climate? (if it's going into Winter at home do you want some Summer sun, and google seasons in different destinations to help narrow down your options)

2. How long can I go away for? (this can really help narrow down options as if you've only got a week off work then is it really worth going all the way to Europe and losing days in travel time, on the flip side if you can take an extended trip maybe look at some Round the World Airfares as they can often be great value)

3. Fly, drive or cruise somewhere? (there are so many ways to travel these days that even if you're not a fan of flying you can still have an amazing adventure)

4. What did you enjoy the most about your last holiday? (was it traveling alone, being at the beach, learning about the history & culture, the food\!)

5. Do you want total relaxation or an action packed adventure? (do you just need a oceanview and cocktail to be happy or be out exploring on quad bikes & zip lining through the forest or a bit of a combination)

6. Do you want to experience new things on this holiday? (like a different culture, cuisine, or language)

If you're like me and enjoy doing a bit a research into options before you commit to making a booking here are some tips that I find helpful.

Once a destination has been decided I like to start looking into what there is to do/see/visit so you can work out how long is ideal. There's nothing worse than booking airfares and accommodation for a week only to realise you really need two weeks to make the most of the destination\!

To start getting an idea on pricing sites like www.skyscanner.com.au and www.expedia.com.au or www.tripadvisor.com.au can be super useful and even give you inspiration if you're still not sure where you want to go and just have a certain budget to stick within.

If you're not great at making decisions and love a hassle free holiday with adventure and like minded travellers then check out the deals section with small group travel operators like www.intrepidtravel.com or www.gadventures.com.au and you'll often find some last min deals discounted which is a great way to get value for money on a trip to somewhere you might not have thought of and meet some amazing people along the way\!
