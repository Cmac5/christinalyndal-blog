If you're heading to the Sunshine Coast for a week here are some must do sights and places you need to include on your trip\!

1\. Noosa National Park

Parking is very limited in my parts of Noosa so if you can get accommodation walking distance to Hastings st and you'll be able to get around without the hassle of trying to find parking.&nbsp;

Specifically the coastal walk,&nbsp;

2\. Kondailla National Park

3\. Maleny Botanic Gardens

4\. Sunset at Happy Valley Reserve

5\. Sunset over Glass House Mountains
